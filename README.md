# University-Management-System

Java project implementing a login system for different user roles: student, lecturer, and administration. 
Each role is assigned unique credentials and has access to specific functionalities within a menu system. 
The system emphasizes case sensitivity for usernames and passwords.

# Project Overview

This Java project implements a role-based system that offers different functionality to users based on their role (student, lecturer, or administrator). Each user role has a unique set of login credentials and access to specific features through a case-sensitive login system. The project ensures that only authorized users can perform actions relevant to their role.

# Key Features

* Case-Sensitive Login System: Users must enter correct usernames and passwords with attention to uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Role-Based Access:  
        ``Students can access student-related functions (e.g., view grades, assignments, etc).``  
        ``Lecturers can manage course-related data (e.g., updating grades, reviewing assignments, etc).``  
        ``Administrators have full control over the system, including managing user accounts and system settings.``
* Predefined Credentials: The system comes with predefined usernames and passwords for testing purposes (see below).
* User-Friendly Menus: Each user role has a customized menu with available options tailored to their permissions.
